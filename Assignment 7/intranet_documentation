Assignment 7
November 13, 2017

A note to the grader:
    - Specific requirements for this particular assignment are identified with multi-line comments
    throughout the Python script files (""" """). In order to test the program, run "main.py" which
    will generate the intranet GUI, and you will be able to log in with the three default users
    declared in "login_intranet.py" or create a new user with a default access level "C".

This project implements the following conventions:
    - Classes follow common naming conventions.
    - Methods and variables are names using snake-case, fully lowercase.

Moreover, the 'intranet__user' file defines the 'User' class which contains the algorithm for
password encryption. Using an SHA-512 algorithm, a user's password is encrypted. This hash is
compared to the hash for the plaintext password provided when a user attempts to log in, in
order to authenticate. SHA-512 is one of the most secure of a large family of hashing algorithms,
SHA-2, developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001, four
years before the family's predecessor series of algorithms, SHA-1, was compromised. SHA-512 is
faster and more secure than its similar algorithm SHA-256, as it uses 64-bit words in contrast
with SHA-256's 32-bit words. It has thus become very common and respected in the field of
cybersecurity.
